      <h3>Building a free city is a massive undertaking</h3>

      <p class="margin">We know how much work it is to build a free city.</p>

      <p class="margin">
        We have built this platform from our experience building a free city and
        we want to share and build a community around this platform.

      <h3>Bitcoin</h3>

      <p class="margin">
        We are firm believer in the Bitcoin protocol and we have built a lot of
        software around it. That doesn't mean all software integrates with
        Bitcoin, some software are standalone without any dependencies on
        Bitcoin or blockchains.
      </p>

      <p class="margin">
        While we love Bitcoin, we also support other blockchains that are
        compatible with the Bitcoin protocol.
      </p>
