      <h1>Mission Statement</h1>

      <p>
        The <strong>Free City Platform</strong> is a platform that is rich with
        features and capabilities that are designed to help citizens in a free
        city to live their lives in a way that is free from the constraints of
        the State.
      </p>

      <p>
        The State institutions that still exists today, was established in a
        different era and under very different circumstances than the ones we
        have today. In some ways they have outplayed their usefulness and in
        their place we can and should construct new means of governance and
        organization that are more suited to the needs of the
        <strong>people of today</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our platform dispatches with all existing institutions and systems,
        there are no legacy from the past that we carry with us. Our platform
        does not have integration with any existing government or state systems,
        regulations or laws.
      </p>

      <p>
        Building a free city from the ground up is a daunting task. The Free
        City Platform mission is to make this effort a little easier. Since we
        are not building on any existing infrastructures, it means we get to
        reimagine and reinvent everything from the ground up.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Who are you?</strong> How does anyone identity you and how do
        you identify yourself? In a state nation you are the legal name you were
        given at birth. You are the social security number you were assigned.
        You are legally bound, shackled and chained to the state. Your number
        and name is used to restrict your freedom of movement, freedom of
        expression and freedom to live your life as you see fit.
      </p>

      <p>
        In a free city and on the Free City Platform, you are
        <strong>free to choose your own names and identities</strong>. Yes, you
        read that correctly. You are not bound to a single identity, you can
        have as many identities as you want. You decide who you are and how you
        want to be identified, and by living your life you will fill those
        identities with meaning and purpose, with relationships, with contracts
        and obligations. Your social life does not need to mix with your
        business life.
      </p>

      <p>
        We believe that knowledge is power, and software is knowledge. We are
        dedicated to building a platform that is open source and free for anyone
        use as they see fit, without restrictions. Knowledge and information
        that is free, cannot be stopped. We are not a corporation, we are not
        few, for we are many and we are everyone.
      </p>

      <p>
        Our platform will always be a work in progress, as there are no absolute
        truths and no final solutions to how humans organize in a society. We
        will always be open to new ideas and new ways of doing things. We will
        always be open to new ways of thinking and new ways of living. We will
        always be open to new ways of being.
      </p>

      <p>We are here for your free city.</p>
